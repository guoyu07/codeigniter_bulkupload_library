# Instructions

Library folder contains `bulk_upload.php` file which is main library. And supporting library is PHPExcel, which is property of respected author.

Controllers folder has one controller and contains one method. Which basically uploads file and validates it. Then pass it to library and prepare data for database operation. You have to do manual work to get this working. 

View contains html file with some jQuery.

PoC folder shows screenshots of how I have implemented in my project.
